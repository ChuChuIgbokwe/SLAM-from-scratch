# This function does all processing needed to obtain the cylinder observations.
# It matches the cylinders and returns distance and angle observations together
# with the cylinder coordinates in the world system, the scanner
# system, and the corresponding cylinder index (in the list of estimated parameters).
# In detail:
# - It takes scan data and detects cylinders.
# - For every detected cylinder, it computes its world coordinate using
#   the polar coordinates from the cylinder detection and the robot's pose,
#   taking into account the scanner's displacement.
# - Using the world coordinate, it finds the closest cylinder in the
#   list of current (estimated) landmarks, which are part of the current state.
#   
# - If there is such a closest cylinder, the (distance, angle) pair from the
#   scan measurement (these are the two observations), the (x, y) world
#   coordinates of the cylinder as determined by the measurement, the (x, y)
#   coordinates of the same cylinder in the scanner's coordinate system,
#   and the index of the matched cylinder are added to the output list.
#   The index is the cylinder number in the robot's current state.
# - If there is no matching cylinder, the returned index will be -1.
